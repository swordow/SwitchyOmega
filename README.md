SwitchyOmegaYA
============

SwitchyOmegaYa is developed based on [SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega)(which is no longer maintained) and [ZeroOmega](https://github.com/zero-peak/ZeroOmega)(which is based on SwitchyOmega too).  
SwitchyOmegaYa updates [SwitchOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega) with chrome mainifest v3 (Most modification comes from [ZeroOmega](https://github.com/zero-peak/ZeroOmega)).  
SwitchyOmegeYa will not add new features and just make it work stable.

Manage and switch between multiple proxies quickly & easily.

Chromium Extension
------------------
The project is now in development.

Please [report issues on the issue tracker.](https://github.com/swordow/SwitchyOmegaYA/issues)

Development status
------------------

## PAC generator
This project contains a PAC generating module called `omega-pac`, which handles
the profiles model and compile profiles into PAC scripts. This module is standalone
and can be published to npm when the documentation is ready.

## Options manager
The folder `omega-target` contains browser-independent logic for managing the
options and applying profiles. Every public method is well documented in the comments.
Functions related to browser are not included, and shall be implemented in subclasses
of the `omega-target` classes.

`omega-web` is a web-based configuration interface for various options and profiles.
The interface works great with `omega-target` as the back-end.

`omega-web` alone is incomplete and requires a file named `omega_target_web.js`
containing an angular module `omegaTarget`. The module contains browser-dependent
code to communicate with `omega-target` back-end, and other code retrieving
browser-related state and information.
See the `omega-target-chromium-extension/omega_target_web.coffee` file for an
example of such module.

## Targets
The `omega-target-*` folders should contain environment-dependent code such as
browser API calls.

Each target folder should contain an extended `OmegaTarget` object, which
contains subclasses of the abstract base classes like `Options`. The classes
contains implementation of the abstract methods, and can override other methods
at will.

A target can copy the files in `omega-web` into its build to provide a web-based
configuration interface. If so, the target must provide the `omega_target_web.js`
file as described in the Options manager section.

Additionally, each target can contain other files and resources required for the
target, such as background pages and extension manifests.

For now, only one target has been implemented: The WebExtension target.
This target allows the project to be used as a Chromium extension in most
Chromium-based browsers and also as a Firefox Addon as mentioned above.

## Building the project

SwitchyOmegaYA has migrated to use npm and grunt for building. Please note that
npm 2.x is required for this project.

To build the project:

    # Install node and npm first (make sure npm --version > 2.0), then:
    
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli@1.2.0 bower
    # In the project folder:
    cd omega-build
    npm run deps # This runs npm install in every module.
    npm run dev # This runs npm link to aid local development.
    # Note: the previous command may require sudo in some environments.
    # The modules are now working. We can build now:
    grunt
    # After building, a folder will be generated:
    cd .. # Return to project root.
    ls omega-chromium-extension/build/
    # The folder above can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chromium now.

To enable `grunt watch`, run `grunt watch` once in the `omega-build` directory.
This will effectively run `grunt watch` in every module in this project.
